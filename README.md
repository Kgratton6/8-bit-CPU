# 8-bit CPU

## Overview

This project involves designing an 8-bit CPU from scratch. The design process began with creating a manual design, followed by defining the instruction set and bit responsibilities. I then developed individual components using Logisim, such as the adder, subtractor, ALU, and registers. The final integration included building a decoder for instructions and a program counter (PC) to execute instructions sequentially.

## 🌟 Features

- **4 Registers**: The CPU contains four registers for storing data temporarily.
- **8 ALU Operations**: Supports eight arithmetic and logical operations to handle various computations.
- **Assembly coding**: Assembly examples.xlsx demonstrates the CPU’s capabilities with assembly code for multiplication and modulo operations, converted into 10-bit instructions.
